# AsyncFileReader

The AsyncFileReader project is a Rust application that demonstrates asynchronous file reading capabilities using the `tokio` library. It allows you to read the contents of a file asynchronously, providing a more efficient and responsive way of handling I/O operations.

## Features

- Asynchronously reads the contents of a file
- Utilizes the `tokio` library for asynchronous programming
- Handles I/O operations efficiently without blocking the main thread

## Requirements

- Rust programming language (version 1.x.x)
- Cargo package manager

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/marcusn1127/async-file-reader.git

2. Change into the project directory:

cd async-file-reader

3. Build and run the project:

cargo run --release

4. Follow the on-screen instructions to provide the path to the file you want to read asynchronously.
